Introduction:

The goal of our project is to design a system that is capable of encrypting a plaintext message of arbitrary length using the Advanced Encryption Standard (hereafter AES) and displaying the resulting ciphertext. Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, is the encryption algorithm used by the U.S. government to protect classified information up to the SECRET level.
